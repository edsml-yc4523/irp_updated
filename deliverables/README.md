Before submission, please ensure your deliverable complies with the **IRP guidelines**, such as the word count, file size, and the number of figures or tables. Commit your project plan, final report, and presentation (**each as a single PDF**) to **this directory** (`deliverables/`). The **file name** must be (all **lowercase**):

| deliverable | filename |
| - | - |
| project plan | `yc4523-project-plan.pdf` |
| final report | `yc4523-final-report.pdf` |
| presentation | `yc4523-presentation.pdf` |

For instance, if your university username is `yc4523`, and you are submitting your project plan, then the filename must be `yc4523-project-plan.pdf` (no whitespaces or uppercase letters). To confirm your submission is correct, **ensure the corresponding GitHub Actions workflow is passing** - workflow badges are in the table above.
